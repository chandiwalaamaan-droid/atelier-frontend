/**
 * Fallback session storage for mobile browsers that block the cross-site
 * SameSite=None cookie the backend sets (iOS Safari's "Prevent Cross-Site
 * Tracking" — on by default — and many in-app browsers drop third-party
 * cookies like this one entirely, even though SameSite=None; Secure is
 * exactly the config a cross-origin cookie is supposed to need).
 *
 * Every login/register/google auth response from the backend already
 * includes the session `token` in its JSON body for this reason (see
 * backend's getTokenFromRequest, which checks Authorization: Bearer as a
 * fallback if there's no cookie) — this was just never being used on the
 * frontend. We store it in localStorage (survives reloads and reopening
 * the app, not just the current tab) and apiFetch attaches it as a Bearer
 * header on every request, alongside the cookie attempt. Wherever the
 * cookie works, both are sent and the cookie is what the backend checks
 * first; wherever the cookie was dropped, this header carries the session.
