/**
 * Minimal in-memory rate limiter, keyed by IP + a bucket name (e.g.
 * "login", "register"). Good enough for a single-instance deployment
 * (which is what Render's free plan gives you) — state doesn't need to be
 * shared across instances because there's only one. If this app ever moves
 * to a multi-instance/autoscaled plan, swap this for a Redis-backed limiter
 * instead, since in-memory state won't be shared across instances there.
 *
 * Fixed window, not sliding — simpler, and fine for "stop obvious brute
 * force" rather than precise rate shaping.
